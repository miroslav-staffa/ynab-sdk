|**accountId** | **UUID** |  |  [optional] |
|**date** | **LocalDate** | The transaction date in ISO format (e.g. 2016-12-01).  Future dates (scheduled transactions) are not permitted.  Split transaction dates cannot be changed and if a different date is supplied it will be ignored. |  [optional] |
